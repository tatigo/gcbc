GC-Blockchain Codefest Repo (#GCBlockchsinDay) 

This repository is a part of a Hackathon 

GCentities is a proposed project to share a central database of information on all Government departments, agencies, and crown corporations
between GC departments and with the public (on an Open Government portal)

Motivation: currently, many entities spend resources maintaining their own databases for their specific mandate activities, 
but in almost all cases the basic information could be created and updated from a single central source and distributed to the departments. Issues to resolve are the appropriate platform, interface, editing permissions, and security levels 
since some departments may use the database for classified/protected activities.
